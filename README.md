## Hi there 👋🏼

My name is Sébastien. I've been coding for a long time and really enjoy to exchange and discover great things about software programming. I believe in the win-win, the opensource and wish a peace-loving world with a pinch of tech.

My past stacks includes Java, PHP, a bunch of SQL. Nowadays I've been gently adbducted by NodeJs and Typescript. A refreshing experience.

I'm from Belgium, living in Brussels. Speak French, English and a *nascent* Spanish.

### Sponsors :heart:

If you are enjoying some of my OSS guides or libs for your company, I'd really appreciate a [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/belgattitude), a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/belgattitude) or a dropped star. That gives me a tasty morning boost and help me to make some of my ideas come true :heart: :pray:
