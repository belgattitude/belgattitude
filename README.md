## Hi there üëãüèº

My name is S√©bastien. Strongly typed by nature, I've been coding for a long time. I really enjoy to exchange and discover great things about software programming. I believe in the win-win, the opensource and wish a peace-loving world with a pinch of tech.

My past stacks includes Java, PHP, a bunch of SQL. Nowadays I've been adbducted by Typescript and NodeJs, cause why not ? It's fun.

I'm from Belgium, living in Brussels. Speak French, English and a frenchized Spanish.

### Sponsors :heart:

If you are enjoying some of my OSS guides or libs for your company, I'd really appreciate a [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/belgattitude), a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/belgattitude) or a dropped star. That gives me a tasty morning boost and help me to make some of my ideas come true :heart: :pray:
