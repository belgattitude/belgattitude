## Hi there 👋🏼

My name is Sébastien. Strongly typed by nature, I've been coding for a long time. I really enjoy to exchange and discover great things about software programming. I believe in the win-win, wish a peace-loving world. 

From Belgium, living in Brussels. Speak french, english and a something that sounds spanish.

### Sponsors :heart:

If you are using my opensource, I'd really appreciate if you would consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/belgattitude). That gives me a tasty morning boost.
