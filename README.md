## Hi there üëãüèº

My name is S√©bastien. I've been coding for a long time and really enjoy to exchange and discover great things about software programming. I believe in the win-win, the opensource and wish a peace-loving world with a pinch of tech.

My past stacks includes Java, PHP, a bunch of SQL. Nowadays I've been gently adbducted by NodeJs and Typescript. A refreshing experience.

I'm from Belgium, living in Brussels. Speak French, English and a passive Dutch.

### Fun fact

I'm a contemporary dancer and choreographer assistant. 

### Sponsors :heart:

If my open source software guides or libraries have been useful to you and your company, I would be grateful for your support. Whether it's through [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/belgattitude), a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/belgattitude), or even just a starred repository, any form of recognition would be a tremendous motivation for me to continue my work. Your support will not only bring me a delightful boost but also help me bring my ideas to life :pray:
